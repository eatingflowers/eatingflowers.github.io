Since I couldn't find this anywhere online...

I'm in the process of moving between computers and I wanted to move all my scripts for [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) from one to the other.  The location of scripts and plugins can be managed in Gimp's settings as shown here:

You can define where you keep your scripts, but I put all of my scripts in

	~/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.8/scripts

There's also a plugins folder in the 2.8 directory where all the plugins go.  This seems to be a standard location, but I don't know why it's so hard to find information about it online.  Hope this is helpful to someone.
