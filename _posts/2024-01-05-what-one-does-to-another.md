What One Does To Another (DUSK004)

The pale dusky purple in the northeastern sky at twilight, the shadow of the earth itself against the sky â€” this is for you.

Back in 2015, when my first album God Was A White-Tailed Deer came out, I put together a mix and interview for a now-defunch Italian music website SoundBound.  The interview was never published and neither was the mix, so I've decided to share it here.  I think this is the last release I'll do as Eating Flowers, and the last on Permanent Dusk.  It'sime for some new colors.

The mix is a love note to cassette tape culture, mostly the synth-heavy explorations of Emeralds et al. circa 2006-2010.  The absolutely sublime photo is by Helena Costa. See more of her work [here](https://www.instagram.com/helenacosta.g/).
