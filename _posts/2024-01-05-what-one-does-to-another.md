Back in 2015, when my first album God Was A White-Tailed Deer came out, I put together a mix and interview for a now-defunch Italian music website SoundBound.  The interview was never published and neither was the mix, so I've decided to share it here.  It's a love note to cassette tape culture, mostly the synth-heavy explorations of Emeralds et al. circa 2008-2010.  Enjoy.

The pale dusky purple in the northeastern sky at twilight, the shadow of the earth itself against the sky â€” this is for you.
