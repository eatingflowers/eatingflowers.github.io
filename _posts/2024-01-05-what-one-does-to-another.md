Eating Flowers - What One Does To Another (DUSK004)

![](/assets/img/Cover.png)

The pale dusky purple in the northeastern sky at twilight, the shadow of the earth itself against the sky — this is for you.

Back in 2015, when my first album [God Was A White-Tailed Deer](https://eatingflowers.bandcamp.com/album/god-was-a-white-tailed-deer) came out, I put together a mix and interview for a now-defunct Italian music website SoundBound.  The interview was never published and neither was the mix, so I've decided to share it here.  The mix is a love note to ambient music cassette tape culture, mostly the synth-heavy explorations of Emeralds, Oneohtrix Point Never et al. around 2006-2010.

The absolutely sublime photo is by Helena Costa. See more of her work [here](https://www.instagram.com/helenacosta.g/).  The photo was taken at a deer park in Portugal and no animals were harmed. :)

I think this is the last release I'll do as Eating Flowers, and the last on Permanent Dusk.  It's time for some new colors.
